1) TWO DIFFERNET VIEWS OF UI (BEFORE LOGIN AND AFTER LOGIN):
    --> Before Login: Publicly accessible pages like Home, Dashboard, Login, Signup.
    --> Get Started button on Home page navigates to Login page.
    --> Report item and Profile links redirect to Login page if not authenticated. (on footer)
    --> On menu bar instead of Report and Profile links, show Login and Signup links.

    --> After Login: Protected pages like Report, Profile.
    --> Add Logout button on menu bar to log out the user.
    
    --> Use conditional rendering based on authentication status to switch between these views.


 
2) LOST AND FOUND ITEMS DASHBOARD:
    --> When no element is present in the Lost or Found items list, show a message indicating that no items are available (for each all, lost and found items).

3) DISPLAY ACTUAL INFO ON HOME PAGE:
    --> Total items reveived till now.
    --> Total Active users.
    --> Total items returned to owners.
