--> USER AUTHENTICATION SYSTEM 

Authentication - The process of verifying the identity of a user or system.
Authorization - The process of determining what an authenticated user or system is allowed to do.



--> WITH AUTH
Only logged-in users can:
Report items
Delete/edit their own reports

Backend can say:
“This item belongs to User #23.
This request came from User #23.
- Allowed.”



--> THINGS TO BUILD FOR AUTHENTICATION

1. User Registration
   - Collect user information (username, password, email).
   - Validate input data.
   - Store user data securely in the database.
2. User Login
   - Verify user credentials.



--> PUBLIC STATE VS AUTHENTICATED STATE

Public State (Before Login): User is a visitor.

    What the user can do:
    View lost items
    View found items
    Search items
    Open item details

    What frontend shows:
    Login button
    Register button
    “Report Item” -> Redirect to login
    “Delete/Edit” -> Hidden or disabled

    What backend assumes:
    “I don’t know who this is.”


Authenticated State (After Login): User is logged in (known identity).

    What the user can do:
    View lost items
    View found items
    Search items
    Open item details
    Report lost/found items
    Delete/Edit their own reports

    What frontend shows:
    Logout button
    Profile button
    “Report Item” -> Opens report form
    “Delete/Edit” -> Visible for own reports

    What backend assumes:
    “This is User #X.”




--> CONTROLLING UI BEFORE & AFTER LOGIN

1. Core Idea:
    - UI is controlled by STATE, not by pages.
    - Login does NOT magically change UI.
    - A single piece of state changes and React re-renders everything.

2. The One State that Controls Everything:
    - Entire app's UI changes based on one boolean idea
    - Conceptually:
        true → Logged in UI
        false → Guest UI
    - This auth state must live in a place where:
        All components can access it
        It survives page navigation





--> JWT (JSON Web Token) BASICS:

1. What problem does JWT solve ?
- HTTP is stateless.
- Server does not remember who you are between requests. The backend forgets you immediately after sending a response.
- Need a way to prove identity on each request.
- JWT is one solution to this problem.


2. Traditional way - Session based
- Server stored session data in memory / DB
- Browser stored a session ID (cookie)
- Every request → browser sends session ID
- Server looks it up

    Problems:
        Hard to scale
        Server memory increases with users
        Not ideal for mobile apps / APIs


3. What is JWT?
- JWT (JSON Web Token) is a self-contained digital identity card that the backend gives to the user after login.
- The frontend sends this card with every request to prove:
“Hey backend, this is me. I already logged in.”
- JWT is a compact, URL-safe token that contains encoded JSON data.
- JWT is created ONLY AFTER LOGIN / SIGNUP
